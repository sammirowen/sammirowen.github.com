            <h1>User Testing</h1>
            <p>
                I learned a lot from user testing, most notably that I need to work on my 
                page layout, because I saw three different screen sizes, none of which worked 
                with my layout (on my screen you could see there was more information/sections below, shown in the 
                picture to the right, which I hoped would inform the user to scroll, but on the tester’s screen 
                none of this was displayed the same). Thus, I will add a scroll signifier, likely a down arrow 
                telling the user to scroll down and that there is more information below. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Everyone liked my image layout and animations, I received feedback to make my hover 
                on the clothing more prominent, informing the user to drag and so I will add that as well. 
                I also need to add a title, which I just haven’t done yet, but that will help with some layout problems as well.
            </p>

                One tester gave me a lot of helpful feedback and suggestions, and I plan to update my design with some of those ideas after iteration. 
                She said to add more images below my original picture frame, to tie into the second part of the page, which 
                I think will relate the design more fluidly. She also suggested adding maybe some other items into the picture 
                frame drags, like a sweatshirt, 90’s clothes, etc. and so I will toy with that idea. Overall, this user testing was 
                helpful and fun to see what everyone else has been working on.
