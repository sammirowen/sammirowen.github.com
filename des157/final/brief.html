    <h1>Project Summary: Every Picture Tells a Story (or Two)</h1>

            <h5>Comparison Project 1, Adrien Laurent's Portfolio</h5>
            <p><a href="https://adrienlaurent.fr/project/fuse/">Adrien Laurent’s portfolio</a> has a lot of interactivity and elements that I’d like to use in my site. 
                First and foremost, I like her inclusion of drawn elements, videos, and photographs, which was something 
                I liked about my initial studio project and would like to expand upon. My favorite page of her's, called "Fuse," allows
                the user to pick up shoes and move and throw them around her screen, and I think that would work well in my fashion site. 
                She also has parts of that page where the pictures zoom and bob, and I’d like to include that in my design as well. 
                Lastly, she has some horizontal scrolling elements, which was something I had attempted to do in my original studio, 
                but based on the feedback I received, it wasn’t super successful or easy to understand, so I will try something similar to her where
                it automatically scrolls a bit.</p>

            <h5>Comparsion Project 2, sa.design</h5>
            <p>This site, <a href="https://www.sa-design.co/">sa.design</a> gave me a lot of inspiration, and was similar to what I had wanted to do in my original studio project. 
                I think the black background with the photos centered and a scrolling title is really cool, and the designer’s use of the 
                “next” hover instead of a traditional mouse would have helped me in telling my users to scroll to the right as well. 
                I like how the designer has the scrolling effect but then if you hover over the photo you can also see more about that photo, 
                which is something I think I’d like to include in my new design. I like the subdued color scheme, where the photos are really 
                the main focus when paired against the dark background, and hope to use this in my project.</p>

            <h4>Project Goals</h4>
            <p>For my final project, my goals are as follows: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add more graphically drawn elements to each photograph, which automatically scrolls/floats horizontally on the home page, 
                    very similarly to Adrein’s home page</li>
                <li>When you click on each horizontal row, a new page will load where you will have the ability to grab the fashion pieces and 
                    place them on a model/look more at each picture</li>
                <li>Learn how to make my own mouse designs </li>
                <li>Create a fun but professional site through nice color schemes and a good font choice</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Interaction Strategies</h4>
            <p>Some Interactions I'd like to include are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pick up and move the fashion piece drawings, which will be divs</li>
                <li>Hover over each row and have the pieces move automatically, so those will
                    be set on a timer
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Experience Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Have fun moving the fashion pieces around the page and placing them on the photograph</li>
                <li>Understand right away what actions they are supposed to perform, based on quality design and inferences</li>
                <li>Enjoy looking through every page</li>
            </ul>
