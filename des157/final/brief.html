    <h4>Project Summary</h4>
    <p></p>

    <h5>Comparison Project 1, Adrien Laurent's Portfolio</h5>
    <p><a href="https://adrienlaurent.fr/project/fuse/">Adrien Laurent’s portfolio</a> has a lot of interactivity and elements that I’d like to use in my site. 
        First and foremost, I like her inclusion of drawn elements, videos, and photographs, which was something 
        I liked about my initial studio project and would like to expand upon. My favorite page of her's, called "Fuse," allows
        the user to pick up shoes and move and throw them around her screen, and I think that would work well in my fashion site. 
        She also has parts of that page where the pictures zoom and bob, and I’d like to include that in my design as well. 
        Lastly, she has some horizontal scrolling elements, which was something I had attempted to do in my original studio, 
        but based on the feedback I received, it wasn’t super successful or easy to understand, so I will try something similar to her where
        it automatically scrolls a bit.</p>
