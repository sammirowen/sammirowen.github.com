                    1990's fashion was full of crazy patterns: polka dots and the infamous dots on dots, 
                    floral and geometric patterns, jewel tones, neon and monochromatic outfits. Nothing 
                    didn’t go together… and for an extra 90’s flare, layer with a 
                    turtleneck and add a fanny pack!

                    Swimsuits went through a range of styles, from high cut bikinis to Baywatch style red 
                    one pieces. Nothing screams early 90s like <q>Saved By the Bell</q> and neon colors with geometric 
                    designs. This swimsuit marries neon and geometric shapes in its frills and collar.

                <p>The 90's were full of patterns! From polka dots to plaid, checkers and geometric shapes. But what
                made the patterns even more fun and interesting were the colors they appeared with! From monochromatic
                to primary, and even neon, there was nothing too "uncool" to wear!

                <p>If you lived through the 90s, you likely owned overalls. And while denim was all the rage, 
                    patterned overalls were making a statement themselves. They were a comfortable 
                    staple, and often worn with a turtleneck under.

                <p id="longer">But children weren't the only ones who rocked overalls, they came in all different
                    lengths: shorts, capris, and pants! People didn't forget to wear them with iconic
                    socks and sandals. They could have cool patterns themselves, or be the catalyst for a groovy shirt.

                    And lastly, a quintessential family picture of the 90's, a light pink and blue geometric patterned shirt and light washed 
                    jeans on the mother in the photo, a patterned, colored overall on the young baby, and color blocks of blues in the young boy's shirt.
