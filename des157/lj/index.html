                <h2>Form Design</h2>
                <date>January 21, 2021</date>
                <p id="forms">
                    The twenty tips to boost usability in form design described many of the problems I encounter 
                    when signing up for a new website or entering in sensitive information for activities like flights 
                    and bookings. The three scenarios that most frustrate me as a user are the hiding of the password I 
                    just entered, the autocompletion or default value option, and pressing the reset button instead of submit. 
                    In all of these scenarios, the design practice usually results in me, as a user, having to re-enter in 
                    my information. I always double check my information is correct, which usually requires me to retype my 
                    password slowly (looking at each letter I press), or in the case of autocompletion, it usually requires
                    me retyping in my name as I use a nickname for some accounts and have to use my real name for others, 
                    which the computer does not decipher between. Many people likely do not encounter this second issue, 
                    much like the issue surrounding color inclusion and colorblind users, which illustrates the importance 
                    of testing and feedback for discovering issues we may not initially recognize as designers.
