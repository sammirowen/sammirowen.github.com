                <h2>What makes a Website an Experience?</h2>
                <date>February 4, 2021</date>
                <p>
                    This website explores New York in 1897 and compares it to New York Present day, mixing
                     multi-media forms, images, videos and music, navigational elements, maps, and an opportunity 
                     to share your postcard with friends (and spread their message and website further!). This site 
                     truly is an immersive experience and extremely interactive, making it much more fun and impactful 
                     than a site that would present still images and blocks of text.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are numerous ways to travel through the site, from scrolling to pressing a next/previous button 
                    through each location, helping the user traverse the site but still feel like they are creating and owning 
                    their experience. My favorite aspect were the images of today, that when hovered over, showed what the site in the 
                    picture would have looked like in 1897, like in the image below of Union Square. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, I also enjoyed the typography, which used various weights and styles and was presented with animations 
                    and movement, a small detail that only increased the effectiveness and interest of the website.

                <h2>Overlays</h2>
                <date>January 28, 2021</date>
                <p>
                    Overlays can be frustrating for users, specifically if there is not an explicit cancel 
                    button or that button is not easily accessible. For instance, buttons that imply they 
                    will actually submit the form, the closable ‘x’ being located in the top right corner 
                    of the window rather than the overlay, or no cancel button and the design intention of 
                    just clicking outside the overlay, all pose problems for users and ruin their experience. 
                    In all of these scenarios, the user freezes, unaware or unable to return to their intended 
                    purpose and oftentimes simply leaves the page and stops the action.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overlays that appear only when the user is about to navigate away from the site can mitigate 
                    some issues; however, I find that sometimes I want to open a new tab, for research or comparison, 
                    and easily  become annoyed by the overlay, which was designed with good intentions but still disrupts 
                    my intentions (especially when the overlay appears repeatedly despite canceling it already).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, it is important to be cognizant of the placement of the close button, the uses and reasons 
                    behind your overlays, and the reactions and feelings your users are going to gain from this overlay. 
                    As the article states, some overlays are helpful (like cautionary messages before preceding or user-initiated 
                    overlays) and others can be more of a hindrance and annoyance to users. Thus, we must proceed with caution and 
                    really think about the reasons behind an overlay.

                <h2>Form Design</h2>
                <date>January 21, 2021</date>
                <p id="forms">
                    The twenty tips to boost usability in form design described many of the problems I encounter 
                    when signing up for a new website or entering in sensitive information for activities like flights 
                    and bookings. The three scenarios that most frustrate me as a user are the hiding of the password I 
                    just entered, the autocompletion or default value option, and pressing the reset button instead of submit. 
                    In all of these scenarios, the design practice usually results in me, as a user, having to re-enter in 
                    my information. I always double check my information is correct, which usually requires me to retype my 
                    password slowly (looking at each letter I press), or in the case of autocompletion, it usually requires
                    me retyping in my name as I use a nickname for some accounts and have to use my real name for others, 
                    which the computer does not decipher between. Many people likely do not encounter this second issue, 
                    much like the issue surrounding color inclusion and colorblind users, which illustrates the importance 
                    of testing and feedback for discovering issues we may not initially recognize as designers.
