                <h2>What makes a Website an Experience?</h2>
                <date>February 4, 2021</date>
                <p class="italics">
                    Disclaimer: the website, impermanence.us, contains nudity as a part of the art practice, but in my 
                    opinion, is done beautifully and tastefully.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website <a href="https://www.impermanence.us/">impermanence.us</a>, artfully couples scrollable images, enamoring typography, 
                    both in terms of font choice and movement, and music to discuss an illusive topic, one 
                    of impermanence and the transformations we take throughout our lives. The images float 
                    onto the page, zooming in and out on a woman, and this coupled with the simplicity of 
                    the black and white color scheme and the black and white photos, treats the audience to 
                    an experience resembling a movie. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are very few words on the site, letting the pictures tell the story along with the 
                    movement and the music, allowing the experience and images to be truly interpreted--much 
                    like the article discussed. However, I would not be nearly as enamored with the site if it 
                    were missing the music, as this plays a deep role in the experience and my interpretation 
                    of the photos, affecting my mood throughout the scroll.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I do have one critique for the site, as when the photos appear and scroll left 
                    to right, the user must continue to scroll down. This confused me and I spent some time thinking 
                    the page was going to move on it’s own since I could not move it by scrolling left to right. 
                    However, I don't know if this is how scrolling sites work. 
                </p>

                <h2>Overlays</h2>
                <date>January 28, 2021</date>
                <p>
                    Overlays can be frustrating for users, specifically if there is not an explicit cancel 
                    button or that button is not easily accessible. For instance, buttons that imply they 
                    will actually submit the form, the closable ‘x’ being located in the top right corner 
                    of the window rather than the overlay, or no cancel button and the design intention of 
                    just clicking outside the overlay, all pose problems for users and ruin their experience. 
                    In all of these scenarios, the user freezes, unaware or unable to return to their intended 
                    purpose and oftentimes simply leaves the page and stops the action.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overlays that appear only when the user is about to navigate away from the site can mitigate 
                    some issues; however, I find that sometimes I want to open a new tab, for research or comparison, 
                    and easily  become annoyed by the overlay, which was designed with good intentions but still disrupts 
                    my intentions (especially when the overlay appears repeatedly despite canceling it already).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, it is important to be cognizant of the placement of the close button, the uses and reasons 
                    behind your overlays, and the reactions and feelings your users are going to gain from this overlay. 
                    As the article states, some overlays are helpful (like cautionary messages before preceding or user-initiated 
                    overlays) and others can be more of a hindrance and annoyance to users. Thus, we must proceed with caution and 
                    really think about the reasons behind an overlay.

                <h2>Form Design</h2>
                <date>January 21, 2021</date>
                <p id="forms">
                    The twenty tips to boost usability in form design described many of the problems I encounter 
                    when signing up for a new website or entering in sensitive information for activities like flights 
                    and bookings. The three scenarios that most frustrate me as a user are the hiding of the password I 
                    just entered, the autocompletion or default value option, and pressing the reset button instead of submit. 
                    In all of these scenarios, the design practice usually results in me, as a user, having to re-enter in 
                    my information. I always double check my information is correct, which usually requires me to retype my 
                    password slowly (looking at each letter I press), or in the case of autocompletion, it usually requires
                    me retyping in my name as I use a nickname for some accounts and have to use my real name for others, 
                    which the computer does not decipher between. Many people likely do not encounter this second issue, 
                    much like the issue surrounding color inclusion and colorblind users, which illustrates the importance 
                    of testing and feedback for discovering issues we may not initially recognize as designers.
